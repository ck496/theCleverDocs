# Shared Folder

This folder contains code and resources shared across the frontend, backend, and lambdas. Use this for types, prompt templates, constants, and utilities that need to be reused in multiple parts of the CleverDocs project.

## Structure
- `types/`: Blog, UploadRequest, etc. (in JSONSchema, Python, or TypeScript)
- `prompts/`: Prompt templates for AI agents
- `constants/`: Enums, roles, status codes
- `templates/`: Markdown blog scaffolds
- `utils/`: File parsers, chunkers, token counters
