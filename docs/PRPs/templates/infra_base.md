# CleverDocs Infrastructure PRP Template

## **MANDATORY: Feature Documentation**

**=¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Upon PRP completion, you MUST create a comprehensive feature implementation summary.

### **Documentation Process**

1. **Use Template**: Copy `docs/features/templates/infrastructure-feature-summary.md`
2. **Create Summary**: Save as `docs/features/implemented/infrastructure/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-infrastructure.md`
3. **Complete All Sections**:
   - Implementation details with phase breakdown
   - All infrastructure files created/modified
   - AWS resources and security configuration
   - Testing performed (validation, deployment, disaster recovery)
   - Monitoring, alerting, and operational procedures
   - Cost optimization and performance considerations

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] **Feature Summary Created**: Comprehensive documentation following template
- [ ] **All Phases Documented**: Each implementation phase with tasks and testing
- [ ] **Infrastructure Catalogued**: All Terraform modules, resources, and configurations documented
- [ ] **Security Verified**: IAM, networking, encryption, and compliance measures documented
- [ ] **Testing Recorded**: All validation, deployment, and DR testing documented
- [ ] **Monitoring Configured**: CloudWatch, alerting, and operational dashboards documented
- [ ] **Cost Optimized**: Right-sizing, reserved instances, and cost monitoring documented
- [ ] **Operational Procedures**: Deployment, maintenance, and incident response procedures documented

**The PRP is NOT considered complete until the feature documentation is created.**

**Note**: Infrastructure PRP template needs to be developed. For now, ensure feature documentation requirements are met for any infrastructure implementations.
