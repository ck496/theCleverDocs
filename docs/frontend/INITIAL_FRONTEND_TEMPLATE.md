- Auto-generate TypeScript types from API responses
- [SPECIFIC_UX_REQUIREMENTS]: [animations, responsive design, keyboard navigation]

**User Experience:**
This [FEATURE_TYPE] enables [USER_JOURNEY] and directly supports CleverDocs' mission of accelerating engineer onboarding through [SPECIFIC_MISSION_ALIGNMENT].

## EXAMPLES:

Reference relevant UI patterns and integrations:

- **Component Library**: [Chakra UI components to use]
- **Data Flow**: [API endpoints from backend/api.py OR mock data]
- **Type Safety**: [frontend/src/types/ OR auto-generated types]

**Expected User Interface Structure** (customize for your feature):

```tsx
// Component hierarchy
<FeatureContainer>
  <Header />
  <MainContent>
    <FilterControls />
    <DataDisplay />
    <InteractionArea />
  </MainContent>
  <Footer />
</FeatureContainer>
```

**User Interactions** (customize based on feature type):

### For CRUD Interfaces:

- View list of [resources] with filtering and sorting
- Click to view detailed [resource] information
- Create new [resource] with form validation
- Edit existing [resource] with optimistic updates
- Delete [resource] with confirmation dialog

### For Content Display:

- Responsive grid/list layouts
- Infinite scrolling or pagination
- Real-time search and filtering
- Sort by multiple criteria
- Export or share functionality

### For Interactive Features:

- Drag and drop functionality
- Real-time collaboration indicators
- Progress tracking and visual feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Touch gestures for mobile users

**State Management** (add as needed):

- `loading`: Show skeleton screens during data fetch
- `error`: Display user-friendly error messages
- `data`: Typed response from API
- `filters`: User-selected filter criteria
- `sort`: Current sort configuration
- `selection`: Multi-select functionality

## DOCUMENTATION:

Follow CleverDocs established patterns:

- **Architecture Guidelines**: `docs/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` â†’ Frontend section
- **Coding Standards**: `docs/development/CODING_STANDARDS.md` â†’ Frontend patterns
- **Testing Requirements**: `docs/development/TESTING_FRONTEND.md` â†’ Component and integration tests
- **Global Rules**: `docs/CLAUDE.md` â†’ Technology stack and validation requirements
- **Current Structure**: `frontend/src/` (component-based architecture)

**External References** (add relevant documentation):

- React patterns: https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react
- TypeScript best practices: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/
- Chakra UI components: https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components
- React Query (if using): https://tanstack.com/query/latest
- [SPECIFIC_LIBRARY_DOCS]: [URL] (if using specialized libraries)

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Architecture Decision** (choose one):

### Option A: Simple Feature âœ… (Recommended for most features)

- Single component file with local state
- Direct API calls using existing client
- Minimal business logic in the UI
- Quick MVP implementation

**Use for**: Basic displays, simple forms, straightforward interactions

### Option B: Complex Feature (For advanced features)

- Multiple components with shared state
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Context providers for cross-component communication
- Separate service layers for API calls
- Advanced caching and optimization

**Use for**: Multi-step workflows, real-time features, complex state management

**My Choice**: [SIMPLE OR COMPLEX] because [REASONING]

**Data Requirements:**

- **API Integration**: [Which backend endpoints to consume]
- **Type Safety**: [TypeScript interfaces to define/generate]
- **Caching Strategy**: [React Query, SWR, or manual caching]
- **Real-time Updates**: [WebSocket, polling, or static data]

**Performance Requirements:**

- **Initial Load**: < 1s for first contentful paint
- **Interactions**: < 100ms response for user actions
- **Data Updates**: Optimistic UI for better perceived performance
- **Bundle Size**: Lazy load components when possible
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**CleverDocs Mission Alignment** (be specific):

- **[MISSION_ASPECT_1]**: [How this UI enables knowledge sharing]
- **[MISSION_ASPECT_2]**: [How this accelerates engineer onboarding]
- **[MISSION_ASPECT_3]**: [How this improves content discovery/creation]

**Integration Requirements:**

- **Backend Integration**: [Specific API endpoints and contracts]
- **Routing**: [React Router integration and URL structure]
- **Authentication**: [Protected routes, user context]
- **Theming**: [Dark mode support, custom themes]

**Testing Requirements:**

- **Component Tests**: [Render, interaction, and state tests]
- **Integration Tests**: [User workflow tests with MSW]
- **Accessibility Tests**: [Keyboard navigation, screen reader support]
- **Visual Tests**: [Storybook stories for component states]

**Accessibility Considerations:**

- **Keyboard Navigation**: [Tab order, focus management]
- **Screen Readers**: [ARIA labels, live regions]
- **Color Contrast**: [WCAG compliance for text and backgrounds]
- **Motion**: [Respect prefers-reduced-motion]
- **Mobile**: [Touch targets, responsive design]

**Error Scenarios to Handle:**

- **Network Failures**: [Offline support, retry mechanisms]
- **Invalid Data**: [Client-side validation, error boundaries]
- **Permission Errors**: [Graceful degradation for unauthorized access]
- **Browser Compatibility**: [Fallbacks for unsupported features]
- **Performance Issues**: [Loading states, progressive enhancement]

**Future Considerations:**

- **Internationalization**: [Text externalization, RTL support]
- **Analytics**: [User interaction tracking, performance metrics]
- **A/B Testing**: [Feature flags, experiment framework]
- **Mobile App**: [React Native compatibility considerations]
