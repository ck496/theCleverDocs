# CleverDocs Features Documentation

This directory tracks all implemented features and their detailed summaries.

```

## Purpose

This documentation serves to:

1. **Track Implementation Progress**: Record what features have been completed and when
2. **Provide Implementation Details**: Document exactly what was built, how it works, and what files were changed
3. **Enable Knowledge Transfer**: Allow team members to understand implemented features quickly
4. **Support Debugging**: Provide detailed implementation context for troubleshooting
5. **Facilitate Maintenance**: Enable easier updates and modifications to existing features

## Naming Convention

Feature documentation files should follow this naming pattern:
- Frontend: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-frontend.md`
- Backend: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-backend.md`  
- Infrastructure: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-infrastructure.md`

## Required Information

Each feature summary must include:

### 1. Feature Overview
- Feature name and description
- PRD/PRP reference
- Implementation date
- Developer/AI agent responsible

### 2. Implementation Details
- **Phase breakdown** with tasks completed
- **Files created/modified** with specific changes
- **Key components/functions** implemented
- **API endpoints** (if applicable)
- **Database changes** (if applicable)

### 3. Testing & Validation
- **Tests created** (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Manual testing** performed
- **Performance considerations**
- **Accessibility compliance** (frontend features)

### 4. Integration Points
- **Dependencies** on other features/components
- **Breaking changes** introduced
- **Migration steps** required

### 5. Future Considerations
- **Known limitations** or technical debt
- **Planned enhancements**
- **Maintenance requirements**

## Process Integration

**MANDATORY**: Every PRP execution MUST result in a feature summary document being created in the appropriate `implemented/` subdirectory. This is enforced through:

1. **PRP Templates**: All PRP templates include feature documentation requirements
2. **CLAUDE.md Rules**: AI agents are required to create feature summaries
3. **Completion Criteria**: PRPs are not considered complete without documentation

## Cross-References

- **PRDs**: Link to original business requirements in `docs/PRDs/`
- **PRPs**: Link to implementation plans in `docs/PRPs/generated/`
- **Code**: Reference specific files and functions in codebase
- **Tests**: Link to test files and coverage reports
